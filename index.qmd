### Abstract

In this age of computational and data-driven science, systematic tracking of the evolution of digital objects like code and data is essential for reproducible research and effective collaboration, crucially addressing the reproducibility crisis prevalent in many research fields, including Psychology.
Still, chaotic workflows are pervasive in science, reflecting a lack of training in tools and practices from software engineering and scientific computing that provide established solutions for collaborative digital work.
Addressing these challenges, we introduced the full-semester course "Version Control of Code and Data: An introduction to Git and DataLad for psychological research", in the Psychology M.Sc. program at University of Hamburg.
At the heart of this course is the "Version Control Book", a dynamic online learning resource that covers essential concepts of version control in scientific settings.
Complementing this resource, we created quizzes and exercises, and shared all materials on GitHub as extendable, open educational resources.
In the first iteration of the course, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students effectively used the online book and successfully engaged in the hands-on exercises and quizzes.
Feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, resulting in four nominations for the university's teaching award, underscoring an enriching learning experience. 
As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated in future semesters and adapted to other learning formats.
Finally, we are committed to continually improving our online resources as open-source projects.
Together, our open educational resources contribute to training researchers essential skills in tracking, organizing and sharing their work, thereby promoting more open, reproducible and effective science. 

### Justification for IGOR Prize

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="More information about the IGOR Prize"}

The Interest Group Open and Reproducible Science in the Biological Psychology Section of the German Psychological Society (IGOR) awards the annual Open and Reproducible Science Prize.

Papers (poster and symposium presentations) presented at PuG 2024 that exemplify the application of open and reproducible science practices or represent metascience on open and reproducible science topics are eligible. The abstract should include statements on the open and reproducible science aspects of the published or unpublished work (this includes, but is not limited to, pre-registration, open data and materials, reproducible analyses, and metascience work).

When submitting an entry, it must be stated that it is to be considered for the IGOR Prize. Applicants will then be contacted separately by email and asked to write a short letter of justification (approx. 100 words).

Based on this information (abstract, justification), the jury will select the most promising entries. Two jury members will look at each shortlisted presentation and evaluate it according to various aspects related to the promotion of openness and reproducibility.

The contribution that best meets the objectives of IGOR will be honoured at PuG 2024 with a certificate and a cash prize of €500.
:::

Addressing the reproducibility crisis, scientists benefit from adopting tools that enable professional digital workflows.
Git, a standard tool in software engineering, enables traceable collaborative development of research outputs, like code and data, but (aspiring) scientists are still not widely trained to use it.
To change this, we created a curriculum on Git, including a 200-page online guide, websites with slides, exercises, and quizzes.
30 MSc/PhD Psychology students were successfully trained already.
All materials, openly developed on GitHub, are freely available for reuse and extension, thereby also showcasing an approach to the FAIR and reproducible development of open educational resources.

- Wir kennen vermutlich alle das "Final".doc Problem
- Und haben erlebt, wie leicht es zu Chaos führen kann
- Texte, Code und Daten auf unseren Computern verändern sich ständig, oft in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen
- Was brauchen wir also?
- Wir wollen wissen, wer, wie was, wieso weshalb warum und wann in *einer* Datei über die Zeit verändert hat
- Wir wollen an parallelen Versionen arbeiten und flexibel miteinander integrieren
- Und wir wollen das ganze kollaborativ, transparent und reproduzierbar gestalten
- Wir brauchen also ein Versionskontrollsystem.
- In unserem Lehrprojekt haben wir Studierenden Git beigebracht, das wohl bekannteste Versionskontrollsystem und ein Standardtool in der Softwareentwicklung
- Wer mehr erfahren will, wie wir das gemacht haben und dabei u.a. ein 180-seitigen Online-Guide geschrieben haben, kommt zu unserem blauen Poster da drüben
