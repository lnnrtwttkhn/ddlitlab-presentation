**Title:** FAIR and reproducible development of open educational resources using Quarto and Git

### Abstract

University staff spend much time and effort developing educational materials that are rarely shared or easily reusable.
Adopting the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability), known for improving research data management, can similarly enhance educational resources, but practical implementations of these principles are few.
In addition, a technical framework for transparent and collaborative development of teaching materials is needed.

We propose an approach using the open-source tools Quarto and Git, which facilitate the FAIR and reproducible development of educational content.
Quarto is a publishing system that supports diverse outputs like articles, websites, and presentations from sources such as Jupyter notebooks or Markdown documents.
It integrates narrative and code from languages like Python, R, and Julia, ideal for dynamic educational materials such as course websites and online textbooks.
Git, a widely-used version control system, tracks file changes, helping users manage revisions and maintain a history of modifications.
Online platforms like GitHub and GitLab allow educators to share materials for extension or reuse and foster effective collaboration.

We exemplify this approach in a full-semester MSc Psychology course at the University of Hamburg, using Quarto and Git to develop and manage a course website, an online textbook, as well as interactive exercises and surveys.
This example demonstrates how these tools can produce transparent and reproducible educational content adhering to FAIR principles that are readily adaptable and reusable.
Major releases of the materials are tagged, annotated with metadata, and archived in repositories like Zenodo, ensuring long-term accessibility.
Together, this approach opens new avenues for participatory and adaptable teaching methods.

### Description

University staff often develop educational materials that are not widely shared or reusable.
Adopting the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) and a framework for collaborative development could improve this situation, but practical implementations are few.

We propose using the open-source tools Quarto and Git for creating and managing educational content following FAIR standards.
Quarto allows publication of various formats such as articles, websites and presentations, integrating text and code from multiple programming languages.
Git tracks changes and maintains history, facilitating revisions.
Platforms like GitHub and GitLab enable sharing and collaborative development.

In a semester-long MSc Psychology course at the University of Hamburg, we used these tools to develop a course website, an online textbook, and interactive materials.
This practical application demonstrates that such tools can produce transparent and reproducible educational resources.
Major releases are archived in established repositories like Zenodo, promoting long-term availability.

### Abstract

In this age of computational and data-driven science, systematic tracking of the evolution of digital objects like code and data is essential for reproducible research and effective collaboration, crucially addressing the reproducibility crisis prevalent in many research fields, including Psychology.
Still, chaotic workflows are pervasive in science, reflecting a lack of training in tools and practices from software engineering and scientific computing that provide established solutions for collaborative digital work.
Addressing these challenges, we introduced the full-semester course "Version Control of Code and Data: An introduction to Git and DataLad for psychological research", in the Psychology M.Sc. program at University of Hamburg.
At the heart of this course is the "Version Control Book", a dynamic online learning resource that covers essential concepts of version control in scientific settings.
Complementing this resource, we created quizzes and exercises, and shared all materials on GitHub as extendable, open educational resources.
In the first iteration of the course, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students effectively used the online book and successfully engaged in the hands-on exercises and quizzes.
Feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, resulting in four nominations for the university's teaching award, underscoring an enriching learning experience. 
As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated in future semesters and adapted to other learning formats.
Finally, we are committed to continually improving our online resources as open-source projects.
Together, our open educational resources contribute to training researchers essential skills in tracking, organizing and sharing their work, thereby promoting more open, reproducible and effective science.
