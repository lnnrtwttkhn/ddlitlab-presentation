## TURN 2024

Scientists at universities spend a lot of time and effort on the development of teaching materials.
However, these valuable educational resources are only rarely shared, and even then hard to find or reuse.
Sharing teaching materials as open educational resources that can reused and extended does not only promise to save limited time but also ultimately improve the quality of higher education.
The FAIR principles, well known in the context of research data management, provide guidelines how to make research outputs, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
Importantly, the FAIR principles can be also applied to educational resources, but concrete approaches  on how to implement them practically are scarce.
Beyond the FAIR principles, a technical framework is needed that allows distributed and collaborative development of teaching materials in a way that ensures transparency, provenance and reproducibility.

Here, we present an approach to FAIR and reproducible development of teaching materials using the open-source software tools Quarto and Git.
Quarto is a free and open-source scientific and technical publishing system developed by the open source data science company Posit (formerly know as RStudio).
Quarto allows to create and publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in various formats like HTML, PDF, MS Word and ePub.
Authors can use Jupyter notebooks or write plain text Markdown in their favorite editor.
As a literate programming tool, Quarto can integrate prose with widely used programming languages like Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
In the context of teaching materials, Quarto may be used to generate course websites, online textbooks and presentations, all within one framework.
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
Git is arguably the most popular version control system.
"Version control is an approach to record changes made in a file or set of files over time so that you and your collaborators can track their history, review any changes, and revert or go back to earlier versions" [@turingway2022].
Version control allows to keep track of changes in a directory (called a "repository").
Users can take snapshots (called "commits") of the repository at any time.
This allows to know the history of changes and understand what was changed when and by whom.
Further, users can compare commits and go back to any previous state of their repository.
In addition, Git allows to work on parallel versions (called "branches") and flexibly integrate (or "merge") them.
Repository hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Codeberg extend the benefits of version control by aspects of collaboration.
Repositories can be uploaded (or "pushed") to an online repository hosting service (called a "remote") and shared with others.
Repositories can be shared privately with a group of trusted collaborators but also made publicly available to anyone.
This allows to work on the same files at the same time.
Others can read, copy, edit and suggest changes.
By making the repository public, work can be shared openly and transparently.
Git is free to use and [open-source](https://github.com/git).
It is a command-line tool and available for all major operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux).
In addition, several graphical user interfaces exist and Git is integrated into many integrated development environments (IDEs) like RStudio and Visual Studio Code.
Git can be considered a standard tool in the software industry and its popularity is evidenced by the 100 million of the popular repository hosting service GitHub ^[(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub))].

We exemplify the implementation of this approach in the context of a full-semester course on „Version Control of Code and Data“ taught in the MSc Psychology at University of Hamburg.
The educational materials mainly comprise a course website, an online textbook as well as online surveys and exercises, implemented Quarto and collaboratively developed using Git and GitHub.
All resources were developed openly and transparently with the full revision history available on GitHub.
Major releases are annotated with metadata and archived in established repositories like Zenodo.

Together, this approach allows to develop and share FAIR and reproducible open educational resources using free and open-source software that is available for all major operating systems and readily integrated with existing institutional infrastructure.
Finally, the implications for education curricula, participatory teaching and are discussed.

### Abstract

In this age of computational and data-driven science, systematic tracking of the evolution of digital objects like code and data is essential for reproducible research and effective collaboration, crucially addressing the reproducibility crisis prevalent in many research fields, including Psychology.
Still, chaotic workflows are pervasive in science, reflecting a lack of training in tools and practices from software engineering and scientific computing that provide established solutions for collaborative digital work.
Addressing these challenges, we introduced the full-semester course "Version Control of Code and Data: An introduction to Git and DataLad for psychological research", in the Psychology M.Sc. program at University of Hamburg.
At the heart of this course is the "Version Control Book", a dynamic online learning resource that covers essential concepts of version control in scientific settings.
Complementing this resource, we created quizzes and exercises, and shared all materials on GitHub as extendable, open educational resources.
In the first iteration of the course, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students effectively used the online book and successfully engaged in the hands-on exercises and quizzes.
Feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, resulting in four nominations for the university's teaching award, underscoring an enriching learning experience. 
As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated in future semesters and adapted to other learning formats.
Finally, we are committed to continually improving our online resources as open-source projects.
Together, our open educational resources contribute to training researchers essential skills in tracking, organizing and sharing their work, thereby promoting more open, reproducible and effective science.

- Wir kennen vermutlich alle das "Final".doc Problem
- Und haben erlebt, wie leicht es zu Chaos führen kann
- Texte, Code und Daten auf unseren Computern verändern sich ständig, oft in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen
- Was brauchen wir also?
- Wir wollen wissen, wer, wie was, wieso weshalb warum und wann in *einer* Datei über die Zeit verändert hat
- Wir wollen an parallelen Versionen arbeiten und flexibel miteinander integrieren
- Und wir wollen das ganze kollaborativ, transparent und reproduzierbar gestalten
- Wir brauchen also ein Versionskontrollsystem.
- In unserem Lehrprojekt haben wir Studierenden Git beigebracht, das wohl bekannteste Versionskontrollsystem und ein Standardtool in der Softwareentwicklung
- Wer mehr erfahren will, wie wir das gemacht haben und dabei u.a. ein 180-seitigen Online-Guide geschrieben haben, kommt zu unserem blauen Poster da drüben
