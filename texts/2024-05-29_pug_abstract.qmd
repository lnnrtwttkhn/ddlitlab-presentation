In the modern scientific landscape, systematic documentation and tracking of the evolution of digital objects are crucial for reproducible research and effective collaboration.
Too often, chaotic workflows persist, especially against the backdrop of the replication crisis and increased demand for open science.
Addressing these challenges head-on, we developed a full-semester elective course titled "Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data" as part of the Psychology M.Sc. (research) program at the University of Hamburg.
Central to the course was our creation of a dynamic learning resource, "Version Control of Code and Data," housed as an open-source online book guide on GitHub.
Complementing this resource, we provided quizzes and shared all course materials via GitHub repositories, contributing to the pool of open educational resources available to the academic community.
Five master students and one Ph.D. student participated in the course. 
Throughout the course, they utilized the provided book as a guide and applied Git to track changes in an example repository. 
The feedback received was generally very positive, we e.g. received four nominations for the Teaching Award of the University of Hamburg, indicating a successful learning experience. 
As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated next semester. 
We've also established an ongoing commitment to continuously enriching our online resources. These resources will undergo regular expansion to ensure they remain dynamic and responsive to evolving needs and advancements in the field.
