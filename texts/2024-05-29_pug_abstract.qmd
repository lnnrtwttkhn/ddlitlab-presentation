In the age of digital and data-driven science, systematic tracking of the evolution of digital objects like code and data is essential for reproducible research and effective collaboration, crucially addressing the reproducibility crisis prevalent in fields such as Psychology.
Still, chaotic workflows are frequent in science, reflecting a lack of training in tools and practices from software engineering that provide established solutions for collaborative digital work.
Addressing these challenges, we introduced the full-semester course "Version Control of Code and Data: An introduction to Git and DataLad for psychological research", in the Psychology M.Sc. program at the University of Hamburg.
At the heart of this course is the "Version Control Book", a dynamic open-source online learning resource that covers essential concepts of version control in scientific settings.
Complementing this resource, we created quizzes and exercises, and shared all materials on GitHub, contributing to the pool of open educational resources.
In the first iteration of the course, six M.Sc. and Ph.D. students effectively used the online book and successfully engaged in hands-on exercises and quizzes.
Feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, resulting in four nominations for the University of Hamburg's Teaching Award, underscoring a successful learning experience. 
As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated in future semesters.
Finally, we are committed to continually improving our online resources as open-source projects.
Together, our open educational resources contribute to training researchers essential skills in tracking, organizing and sharing their work, thereby contributing to more open, reproducible and effective science.
