In the modern scientific landscape, systematic documentation and tracking of the evolution of digital objects are crucial for reproducible research and effective collaboration. Too often, chaotic workflows persist, especially against the backdrop of the replication crisis and increased demand for open science. It is in response to these challenges that the idea for a course emerged, aimed at providing master's students and doctoral candidates with a deeper understanding of version control. The course, an elective for the University of Hamburg's new international master's program in Psychology (M.Sc. research), was titled 'Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data.' We created a learning resource for itâ€”an open-source online book guide named "Version Control of Code and Data," available on GitHub. Additionally, we shared our created quizzes and slides in GitHub repositories, contributing to open educational resources. Five master students and one Ph.D. student participated in the course. Throughout the course, they utilized the provided book as a guide and applied Git to track changes in an example repository. The feedback received was very positive, we e.g. received four nominations for the Teaching Award of the University of Hamburg. indicating a successful learning experience. As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated next semester. We've also established an ongoing commitment to continuously enriching our online resources. These resources will undergo regular expansion to ensure they remain dynamic and responsive to evolving needs and advancements in the field.
