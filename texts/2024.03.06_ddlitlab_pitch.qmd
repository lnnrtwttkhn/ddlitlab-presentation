So many phd students and researchers struggle with organizing their analysis code, doesn´t matter if it is written in R, Python, Matlab or in which language.
A lot of scientists do not have a good solution to recover older versions and collaborate efficiently with others.
Even though there is a very good solution to manage code,the tool Git,  which is the goldstandard in the computer science industry and has been for many years,.
As sciences like psychology get more and more intertwined with informatics we need to teach effictive mangement of code to the researchers of the futures.
Thats why we organized this course: "Version control of Code and Data" last semester in the new psychology research master. 
We created an online guide to teach Git from scratch to students who don´t have previous knowledge of computer science and are not in the typical target group of Git
To lead by example, we used GitHub to share our learning materials, including our guide, our slides and quizzes,
That means everybody can use them and we hope the guide will be a "living ressources" with people adding content.

We got great feedback by our students and are happy to say that the course will be repeated next semester!
